// Napa.js is a multi-threaded JavaScript runtime built on V8,
// which was originally designed to develop highly iterative services
// with non-compromised performance in Bing. As it evolves, we find it useful
// to complement Node.js in CPU-bound tasks, with the capability of executing
// JavaScript in multiple V8 isolates and communicating between them.
// Napa.js is exposed as a Node.js module, while it can also be embedded in a host process without Node.js dependency.

// In Napa.js, all works related to multi-threading are around the concept of Zone,
// which is the basic unit to define policies and execute JavaScript code.
// A process may contain multiple zones, each consists of multiple JavaScript Workers.

// Within a zone, all workers are symmetrical: they load the same code, serve broadcast and execute requests in
// an indistinguishable manner. Basically, you cannot ask a zone to execute code on a specific worker.
// Workers across different zones are asymmetrical: they may load different code,
// or load the same code but reinforce different policies, like heap size, security settings,
//  etc. Applications may need multiple zones for work loads of different purposes or different policies.

// Problems
// When you keep increasing the matrix size (say for an example 10000x10000)
// you will run out of memory pretty soon. The reason for this is, when you
// share data across each worker data is copied over to each workerâ€™s heap space.
// This makes Napa.js consume a lot of memory. As I mentioned above, in future,
// different memory sharing patterns will be used to improve the performance of Napa.js
